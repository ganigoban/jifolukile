Thornton II, who was piloting the aircraft and found it to be carrying too much weight. To avoid getting caught, Thornton jumped out of the plane with a faulty parachute and subsequently died.</p><p>The bear’s body was discovered three months later in northern Georgia, alongside 40 opened plastic containers of cocaine. The creature was given the name “Cocaine Bear” by the Kentucky for Kentucky Fun Mall in Lexington, Kentucky, where it is currently on display. The filmmakers have used this incident as inspiration for the plot of their movie.</p><p>The film is a blend of dark humor, suspense, and crime thriller elements, and promises to be an entertaining watch. With Elizabeth Banks at the helm, and Jimmy Warden penning the script, audiences can expect a unique and thrilling experience. As the story of Cocaine Bear continues to fascinate people even decades after it occurred, the film promises to bring this bizarre and tragic event to a new generation of viewers.</p><p>In December 2019, it was announced that Phil Lord and Christopher Miller would produce an untitled horror comedy project inspired by a true story. The film was based on a spec script written by Jimmy Warden. Lord and Miller initially approached Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, who are part of the Radio Silence collective, to direct the movie. However, both directors opted to make the fifth installment of the “Scream” franchise instead, leaving the horror-comedy project without a director.</p><p>On March 9, 2021, Universal Pictures confirmed that the film was in development, with Elizabeth Banks directing and producing the movie alongside Max Handelman for Brownstone Productions. Banks and Handelman joined Lord, Miller, Aditya Sood for Lord Miller Productions, and Brian Duffield as part of the producing team. The ensemble cast was later revealed between July and August 2021.</p><p>Principal photography for the film took place in County Wicklow, Ireland, between August 20 and October 17, 2021. The production budget for the movie was $35 million, with a significant portion of the budget going to Wētā FX to create the bear with CGI.</p><p>With Banks taking the helm as the director, and a star-studded cast bringing the story to life, the untitled horror-comedy project promises to be an entertaining and thrilling movie experience. As the details of the film’s production continue to emerge, fans eagerly await the release of the movie to see how the true story that inspired it has been transformed into a cinematic masterpiece.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why is Cocaine Bear Rated ‘R’?</h2><p>The upcoming release of “Cocaine Bear,” a Universal Pictures film, has been generating buzz among moviegoers. The movie, which is set to hit theaters on Friday, has been given an R rating for its content. The rating is due to the film’s portrayal of “bloody violence and gore, drug content and language throughout.”</p><p>The plot of the movie is inspired by true events, where a 175-pound American black bear consumed a duffel bag filled with cocaine and died shortly after. The bear’s body was discovered three months later in northern Georgia, alongside 40 opened plastic containers of cocaine.
