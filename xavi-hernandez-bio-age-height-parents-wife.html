Throughout his illustrious career, he secured 32 trophies, making him the second-most decorated Spanish player, trailing only his former teammate Andrés Iniesta.</p><p>Xavi’s impressive list of accolades includes six appearances in the FIFA FIFPro World XI from 2008 to 2013 and five selections to the UEFA Team of the Year from 2008 to 2012. In 2020, he was honored with a place in the Ballon d’Or Dream Team, a compilation of the greatest players of all time by France Football. Notably, Xavi is among the few players to have surpassed 1,000 professional career appearances.</p><p>Beginning his football journey at Barcelona’s youth academy, La Masia, at the age of 11, Xavi made his debut for the first team at 18 in August 1998. His remarkable contribution includes 767 official matches and 85 goals, establishing him as a club legend. Xavi also holds the distinction of being the first player in Barcelona’s history to participate in 150 European and FIFA Club World Cup matches combined.</p><p>During his tenure with Barcelona, <a href=# rel=noopener>Xavi</a> clinched eight La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions League titles. In 2015, he moved to Al Sadd, where he secured four additional trophies before retiring in 2019. Internationally, Xavi played a pivotal role in Spain’s triumphs at the FIFA World Cup in 2010, UEFA Euro 2008, and UEFA Euro 2012. He announced his retirement from international football after the 2014 FIFA World Cup.</p><p>Xavi’s impact goes beyond his playing days, as he transitioned to coaching. After winning seven titles in less than three years with Al Sadd, he returned to Barcelona in November 2021 as the manager. In his first full season, he led the team to victory in the 2022–23 Supercopa de España and the 2022–23 La Liga title.</p><p>Known for his ability to find and exploit space as a deep-lying playmaker, Xavi’s playing style focused on intelligent ball distribution and maintaining possession. Despite lacking pace and physicality, his technical skills, vision, and ball control made him a maestro on the field. Nicknamed “The Puppet Master,” Xavi’s influence extended beyond his playing ability, earning praise for his leadership qualities.</p><p>In his coaching role, Xavi continues to adhere to the principles of the Barcelona style, drawing inspiration from his experiences with coaches like Johan Cruyff and Pep Guardiola. He emphasizes the importance of managing the dressing room, blending coaching and psychological aspects to create a cohesive team.</p><p>Off the field, Xavi has been associated with Adidas and participated in various campaigns, including FIFA’s “11 against Ebola” initiative in 2014, where he joined other top football players to raise awareness about the disease.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Xavi Hernández Age</h2><p>As of January 28, 2024, he was 44 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Xavi Hernández Height</h2><p>He is known to have a height of 1.70 meters.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Xavi Hernández Parents</h2><p>The names and details of his parents are not known.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Xavi Hernández Wife</h2><p>His wife is known as Núria Cunillera and they got married in 2013.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Xavi Hernández Children</h2><p>He is known to be a father of two – a son and a daughter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Xavier Hernández Net Worth</h2><p>Xavier Hernández has an estimated net worth of around $40 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrGYr6FdnbKzusCnm56yXZe2sHnAoJxmoJWetKnAjKmYq52eqcBuw8ifnGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cross-the-brazos-at-waco-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                    Marty Robbins                                          Cross The Brazos At">&larr;
