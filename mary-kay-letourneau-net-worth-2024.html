However, her conviction led to her losing her teaching license and her job.</p><h2 id=income-from-book-sales-fugYdkVzHw>Income from Book Sales</h2><p>After her release from prison, Letourneau co-authored a book with Fualaau titled “Only One Crime, Love” which detailed their controversial relationship.
