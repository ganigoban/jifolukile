Keep in mind they took my bags without consent. My security has already advised them those pre-rolls belong to him. Oh yea & the pilot wants me to take my IG post down," she continued.&nbsp;</p><p id=ea9Ta1WmLT data-wc=54>Nicki also suggested that it was an attempt to stop her from performing because "they’re being paid big money to try to sabotage my tour b/c soooooo many ppl are mad that it’s this successful & they can’t eat off me. They got caught stealing money from my travel/jets. Got fired. Got mad. Etc."</p><p id=erRZYyoQkr data-wc=52>The rapper went on to claim that she "found out [that] for years [they] were adding on 30-50K on my jet & pocketing it," and alleged that she had also fired a tour manager for the same thing and continued, saying "their goal is to make me late, & to pocket 40K".</p><h2>Is Nicki Minaj performing in Manchester?</h2><p id=eUupy3q9MQ data-wc=41>Her last tweet was sent just before 4pm UK time, and Co-Op Live, the venue where she was scheduled to perform, has told fans doors will now open at 7pm.
