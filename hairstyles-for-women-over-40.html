More often than not, they've ditched chasing trends for an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>evolved personal style</a> that reflects the self-assured woman they've become: a woman who knows who she is and what she likes. And as the short-haired soccer mom stereotype continues to fade — and let's please retire the bad "mom cut" jokes — we consulted celebrity stylists Frédéric Fekkai, Stacey Ciceron, and Michelle Sultan, for their favorite hairstyles for the esteemed 40+ club.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The only don't for a woman-over-forty-haircut is to get a style that isn't authentic to them," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Ciceron</a>, hairstylist and Oribe educator.

"Just because you are over 40, you definitely shouldn't settle for what the world tells you that you should have. Keep pushing boundaries — older doesn't equal boring, so don't hesitate to try new, adventurous styles."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Boost your curl shape by combing ahydration serum, like the cult-classic gloss from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Kérastase</a>, through hair with your fingers to add volume and definition to lackluster curls and waves, taking inspo from the always striking Sandra Oh.
