Not only does it smell amazing (it has a light, refreshing rosemary and mint scent), but it also makes my hair feel amazing. The oil is infused with biotin (a vitamin that helps with the production of keratin), rosemary oil (known to help fight balding and improve hair retention), and 30 other essential oils and nutrients.
