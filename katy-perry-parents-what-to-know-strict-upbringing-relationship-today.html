I don't try to change them anymore, and I don't think they try to change me. We agree to disagree."</p><p id=e43MN5YaKNL_ data-wc=58>During a 2017 appearance on the <a class=hm-link href=#>Today Show,</a> she similarly said: "They don't agree with some of the things I do and they do wish that I could do other things," though she maintained: <strong>"My parents are great, and I love them so much,"</strong> and even added: "I cry sometimes thinking about how much I love them."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/35738107ceaa-gettyimages-84707110.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>What has Katy Perry said about what her strict childhood was like?</h2><p id=e-15uFNoHF85 data-wc=22>During the aforementioned interview with VF, Katy declared she "didn't have a childhood," as a result of her parents' strict, religion-led rules.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e422a341b8cb-gettyimages-1169513328.jpg><p id=ePBMrIHg8wc7 data-wc=66>She recalled how her mother never read her any books other than the Bible, being prohibited from saying things like "deviled eggs" or "dirt devil," or listening to secular music, and her fears of getting "bombed" when she first visited Planned Parenthood, having grown up thinking it was exclusively an "abortion clinic," as opposed to the women's health center with wide-ranging services that it actually is.</p><p id=eW_DslOwK55Q data-wc=90>Katy also remembered always having a sense of skepticism when it came to faith, and said: "I have always been the kid who's asked 'Why?' In my faith, you're just supposed to have faith. But I was always like, 'Why?'" adding: "At this point, I'm just kind of a drifter. I'm open to possibility. My sponge is so big and wide and I'm soaking everything up and my mind has been radically expanded. Just being around different cultures and people and their opinions and perspectives.
