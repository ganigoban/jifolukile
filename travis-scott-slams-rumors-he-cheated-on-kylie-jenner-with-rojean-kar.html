However, there had previously been chatter that Kar was why he and Kylie broke up in 2019.</p><p>Within the past few days, fans believed the couple might have gotten back together again as rumors were swirling online about their whereabouts.</p><p>The new speculation arrived due to Scott and Kar sharing Instagram Story slides, leading eagle-eyed fans to notice they were both on location at the same set.</p><p>Reportedly, Scott was on the set for an undisclosed project, which some believed might be a music video he was working on with Pharrell.</p><p>Instagram account @theshaderoom shared side-by-side slides showing their two IG Story posts.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-scott-addresses-cheating-rumors-kar-fires-back>Travis Scott addresses<strong> </strong>cheating rumors, Kar fires back</h2><p>Taking to his Instagram Story after the cheating speculation surfaced, <a href=#>Travis Scott</a> shared his reaction to the rumors, blasting individuals for the “fictional storytelling.”</p><p>“It’s a lot of weird s**t going on. An uninvited person was sneaking photos on what was supposed to be a closed set while I was directing a video,” Scott wrote.</p><p>“I’m saying this for the last time. I don’t know this person. I’ve never been with this person. So please stop with the continuous cyber games and the fictional storytelling,” he wrote.</p><p>The @theshaderoom IG account shared a screenshot of what Scott posted. In a second slide (below), they uploaded a video Kar shared on her IG Story in which she calls out Scott for lying.</p><p>“Ok, so what we’re not gonna do, is we’re not gonna lie on me because I’ve been good. I’ve posted whatever f***ing story you guys wanted me to post. I pretended I didn’t know you. I went along with whatever f***ing narrative you guys wanted to no matter how much bulls**t I got from it,” Kar said.</p><p>“But to say you don’t know me and you’ve never been with me when you’ve definitely been with me. Everybody’s seen you with me. When I have pictures and videos of you with me. Come on,” she said in her video.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Travis Scott’s employee shared additional comments in his defense</h2><p>Along with the IG Story comments that Scott posted reacting to the recent rumors, he also got some thoughts from a friend or associate who backed him up.</p><p>“big cap. I’ve been working with Travis for 8 years + I was on set all day as he was directing a video for another artist. This lady is delusional + she was not there with him. he does not f*** with her in any way. nothing else to see here,” an individual with the handle @courtneyluxe said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/travis-scott-instagram-story-friend-comments.jpg><p>Scott, 31, was first linked with reality TV and <a href=#>social media icon Kylie Jenner</a> in 2017 when they were spotted together at Coachella.
