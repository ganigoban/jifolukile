We won the money, but we didn’t even think of that. We definitely talked about giving back,” Hannah said, admitting she had a lot of thoughts and emotions at once.</p><p>Marco explained they took things “day by day” while living in the villa and said he viewed it as “I get another day with [Hannah]” every time America voted for them to stick around.</p><p>Since they were “boyfriend and girlfriend,” Maura asked them if they’d exchanged numbers. They admitted they hadn’t, with Marco indicating they already would have if they had their phones there.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Hannah and Marco are Love Island USA 5 winners</h2><p>While speaking with Maura, Hannah admitted one of her favorite moments during the season was getting to return from Casa because she was “going through it” mentally at that time.</p><p>That highlight moment arrived as Marco’s ex-girlfriend was brought into the mix, making things extra stressful for Hannah to learn about from afar.</p><p>“You never know what to expect in here,” she said, adding, “So that was a lot, especially because we were going so good.”</p><p>Hannah said when she saw Marco again, she told herself, “I really gotta trust in this man” as they continued their relationship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Marco, 22, was one of the initial contestants introduced in the villa in just the first episode of Season 5. Hannah arrived shortly after as one of two Bombshells with <a href=#>Carmen Kocourek</a>, as they entered the villa with returning Islander Carsten “Bergie” Bergersen.</p><p>Marco was initially coupled with Destiny but then chose to couple with Hannah on Day 5. Hannah decided to remain with Marco when she could choose a man on Day 11. They then lasted through the rest of the season, which included Marco’s ex arriving.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>See Sarah Hyland reveal the Love Island USA 5 winners</h2><p>Host <a href=#>Sarah Hyland</a> revealed the winners at the finale as Marco and Hannah. The winning couple embraced while their castmates, the three runner-up couples, cheered and applauded them.</p><p>Based on the final results, Kassandra “Kassy” Castillo and Leonardo Dionicio finished second, while <a href=#>fan-favorite Bergie</a> and Taylor Smith were third. Coming in fourth place were Carmen and Kenzo Nudo. Some <a href=#>fans speculated they were “scammers”</a> due to living in the same state and having the same personal trainer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>After the winning couple had a moment to collect themselves, they commented about their relationship and how it endured the season.</p><p>“I just feel really blessed to even just be here right now and have found love,” Hannah said as she was caught up in the moment.</p><p>“We just complement each other so well. This journey has been a roller coaster of emotions, but to stand here as the last couple that America has chosen is truly an honor,” Marco said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fans react to Season 5 winners Marco and Hannah</h2><p>Following the reveal of the Season 5 winning couple, fans had mixed reactions to Hannah and Marco as winners. Some were all for it, while others were skeptical.</p><p>One commenter said the winners’ “relationship is so kind, solid, warm and loyal,” adding that Marco “was tested and didn’t waiver” and that Hannah was “incredibly supportive and loving through his grief.”</p><p>Another commenter mentioned that they “started out hating Marco” but then “voted for them all the way through,” suggesting they changed their mind about him and his relationship with Hannah.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/love-island-usa-fans-react-to-winners.jpg><p>Several fans expressed that they thought a different couple should’ve won, while others speculated the winning couple’s relationship wouldn’t continue for very long beyond the show.</p><p>“Let me announce the true winners of this season, Kenzo and Kassy!” an individual commented, adding, “the only two who truly fell in love.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fans-says-kassy-leo-were-love-island-true-winners.jpg><p>“Should of been Leo and kassy cus of their journey but I’m not mad,” one commenter wrote.</p><p>“They won’t make it out the villa…..let’s start making bets how long they last. ….SMDH,” another wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fans-react-hannah-marco-win-love-island-usa-5.jpg><p>Fans are now waiting to see if there will be a reunion like last season to catch everyone up on where things stand between the various castmates. So far, there’s been no report of an event for Love Island USA 5, although they may decide to continue the tradition from last season!</p><p>Love Island USA 5 episodes are available for streaming on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5ykw6Z5yKyjmqaUYsK0rYycqaivnqh6tLHArKanZWVixKq6zZ6prGWRqHqnrc2sZKudkZjBbsDOZpqoraChsnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./megan-vaughn-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Megan Vaughn Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr;
