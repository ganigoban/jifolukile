However, it is yet to be confirmed if they are actually dating.</span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>As for his height, while KJ Apa may not be the tallest man you’ll see on set, he still has a pretty good height, standing at 5ft 11in (180cm).&nbsp;In addition, Apa weighs 73 kg.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMpKFmmaCWeqm10maYoJ1dnbKqs8etZKChoqGzs7XEp5tmqJGnsq%2FA0malnqxdrLyzwMdmoKxlmJp6qK3YaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-riese-lenders-riese-lenders-lindsey-gleiche-four-others-died-plane-crash.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Riese Lenders? , Riese Lenders &amp;amp; Lindsey Gleiche four Others Died Plane Crash">&larr;
