Grey’s Anatomy alum Jesse Williams, who made his Broadway debut in Take Me Out in 2022, wasn’t afraid to wear his birthday suit for the sake of the story.</p><p>“If somebody had just said it’s a play with nudity, it would have been framed differently,” he told the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Associated Press</a>. “But the nudity is honest. It makes sense. It’s not salacious. It serves the story. It puts the audience in an interesting position to relate to and empathize with the characters.”</p><p>Whether it’s to enhance to story of a play, or the performance as a band (we’re looking at you, Blink-182 and Red Hot Chilli Peppers), many celebrities have bared it all in front of a live audience.
