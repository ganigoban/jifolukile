So flavorful, you don’t even need the gravy!</p><p>We are 6 days away from Thanksgiving and I wanted to sneak in one more side dish because these mashed potatoes are unreal! Last year I was super inspired by my friend, Jordan’s Thanksgiving menu (if you want to know the story about how we came to know Jordan and why he is so special to our family, read the story at the end).</p><p>As soon as I saw that he was serving Boursin Cheese Mashed Potatoes, I knew that I had to try them stat. I drove right to Costco, picked up a 3-pack of Boursin cheese, and came home and made these Creamy Boursin Cheese Mashed Potatoes and am officially hooked.</p><p>I am a sucker for Boursin Cheese on its own but you add it to potatoes, butter, and cream and we are in business! You don’t even need gravy with these mashed potatoes because they are THAT good.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Boursin-Cheese-Creamy-Mashed-Potatoes-4-edit-scaled.jpg alt="Boursin Cheese Creamy Mashed Potatoes Buttery, creamy homemade mashed potatoes with garlic and herb Boursin cheese. So flavorful, you don't even need the gravy!" width=1934 height=2560 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>These Mashed Potatoes with Boursin Cheese are made with Yukon Gold potatoes, salted butter, milk or cream, salt, and herb and garlic Boursin Cheese. That’s it! When I am making mashed potatoes, I always reach for Yukon Gold potatoes because its texture is much creamier than a russet potato. If you want creamier, richer mashed potatoes, I suggest using heavy cream or half-n-half but you can also use whole milk.&nbsp;</p><p>You can use any flavor of Boursin cheese in this recipe. If you want an extra pop of flavor, use two Boursin cheese rounds. The mashed potatoes will just be extra creamy!</p><p>I have shared my Traditional Creamy Mashed Potatoes Recipe on Modern Honey so if you are looking for &nbsp;classic mashed potatoes, <span><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>click HERE</strong></a></span>.</p><p>One of the keys to ensure your mashed potatoes are creamy is to heat the butter and half-n-half together before adding to the potatoes. If you add the cold ingredients, the potatoes may end up with a gummy texture.&nbsp; By adding warm butter and milk to the warm cooked potatoes, it keeps them at an optimal temperature for creaming. This is an extra step but makes a huge difference.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Boursin-Cheese-Creamy-Mashed-Potatoes-6-scaled.jpg alt="Boursin Cheese Creamy Mashed Potatoes Buttery, creamy homemade mashed potatoes with garlic and herb Boursin cheese.

I grew up with 5 brothers and I am the only girl. All of my brothers served church missions at the age of 19. This means that they went and served for two years in a place that they were just called to. &nbsp;My brothers served in Virginia, Mexico, Spain, Denmark, and Argentina. They all loved their missions and the opportunities to serve others.&nbsp;</p><p>My youngest brother, Eric, was serving in Argentina. He was out for about 10 months when one morning he and his companion were traveling in a taxi to a nearby town. They were on a highway and a semi-truck crossed the center line and hit the taxi head-on. Eric was in the front seat.&nbsp;</p><p>He sustained massive head injuries and was in a coma…thousands of miles away. When we heard the news, we were beyond devastated. The next few days we spent praying, fasting, crying, and holding on to every ounce of hope. Those days are etched in my mind forever. My parents began booking tickets right away to fly to Argentina to be with him.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, another missionary went to visit him in the hospital to pray for him and give him a blessing. This was Jordan Councill. Since we couldn’t be there, we were so grateful that someone was watching over him. He called to tell us his experiences with him. He stayed with him, talked to him (even though Eric couldn’t talk), played music and uplifting messages.</p><p>My parents didn’t make it to Argentina. We didn’t receive the news we were hoping for. The swelling was too great on his brain and we lost him. Eric passed away a few days after his accident.&nbsp;</p><p>It was the hardest and most painful, gut-wrenching, heartbreaking thing we had to go through. You never expect those calls. But we are grateful for angels like Jordan Councill, who were there with him when we couldn’t get there fast enough.</p><p>I hope each of you had people in your life who have acted like angels for you and have lifted you up when you have struggled or mourned. There are so many who helped us through this trial and we are forever grateful for them. I learned a lot from losing my brother and will never be the same. Of course, we know that trials can make you better or bitter. I watched in absolute awe at my parents and how they handled such a heartache of losing their son while serving a mission. Instead of being angry, bitter, and demanding why this could happen, they decided to focus on his life and our memories with him. They became grateful for the time…the wonderful 19 years with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Life can be full of adversity, struggles, beauty, joy, happiness, sorrow, and so many things. I will always be grateful and cherish my years growing up with my little bro, Eric. I miss him.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Melissa-and-Eric.jpg alt="Eric Driggs" width=1249 height=1249 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><span class=cp-load-after-post></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvDnqmnoJ%2Bjsrp6wqikaJqfqr%2B0tc1mmqGdlaiybq%2FRnpimsV2irrS0xJ1kqaeklsGwsdJo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cheesy-baked-rigatoni.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cheesy Baked Rigatoni  Modern Honey">&larr;
